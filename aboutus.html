<h3>our ICAS company was started in the year2022. It was all started with a thought of world, as today the condition of our globe is so devastating and the one of the big reason for this all is only "US". To make a huge impact to our society we came up with the idea of "ICAS COMPANY", we all came up with recycliable items and we want to make our team to spread all over the world as to make people aware about the benifits of recycliable items ......<br></br>
We started with a small warehouse but now due to contribute of a lot of people we are here today.<br></br>In the year we expanded our range and found our home online, selling to customers from over 160 countries, and the company continues to grow day by day .We have huge plans to continue to raise awareness and increase the number of products we offer to target as many single use plastic products as possible.</h3></center><br></br>


<center><h1 style="background-color:lightgreen;"<label>----------ICAS OFFERS TO GOVERNMENT IS UNIQUE------------</label></h1></center><br></br>
<p><h3>*It starts with an experienced team with direct exposure to both public sector (successfully implementing a multi-year RE programme as former public officials in a very complex environment) and private sector.<br></br>

*It includes innovative tools specifically designed for governments, such as the iTrust and the AREA digital platform, to successfully analyse, design, run and de-risk public RE programmes and unlock financial resources at scale (and at cheaper prices).<br></br>

*It focuses on real impact and programme implementation, an area where most governments usually lack capacity and proper specialised technical support.<br></br>

*It is independent and free of charge for governments, thanks to the support of our donors.</p><br></br></h3>

<p><h3>ICAS team typically does not operate as an “external consultant''. On the contrary, we aim to work closer to governments, as an extended part of their teams, making available the type of support and tools we wished to have and didn’t have when we were working in government.<br></br>


ICAS collaborates with national and international organisations committed to accelerating the energy transition in their countries and globally. A strong network of partners is a key component of our strategy, helping us engage with more governments in developing countries and scale up our impact at a faster pace.<br></br>


We are expanding our organisation and network of partners in Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin & Central America, and Eastern Europe.<br></br></h3></p><br></br>
